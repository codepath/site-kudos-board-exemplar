# Kudos Board

## Introduction

In this project, you will be building a Kudos board that allows users to create themed boards and leave praise and notes of encouragement to other users.

We will put together our learnings from the previous four units to create our very first full-stack project from start to finish. You will work in your Capstone Pods for this project.

## Sample Site

For inspiration, you can view a simple sample website [here]([https://kudos-board.onrender.com/).
